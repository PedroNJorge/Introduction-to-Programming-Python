<h2>[IP094] Game of Life</h2>

<p><img src="./6620676068878116" align="right">
Sasuke Uchiha, known for his analytical mind and relentless pursuit of knowledge, has stumbled upon the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a>, a two-dimensional cellular automaton devised by the mathematician <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John Conway</a>. Intrigued by its resemblance to the cycles of growth and destruction he has observed in the world, Sasuke decides to study its dynamics. However, creating the simulation proves to be a challenge, and he seeks your assistance.</p>

<p>In the game of life, a grid of cells evolves over time based on a few simple rules. Sasuke wants to see how an initial grid changes over multiple generations.</p>

<p>In the grid each cell can be occupied by an organism or not. Occupied cells are said to be <b>alive</b> and unoccupied cells are said to be <b>dead</b>. In each generation, the cells that are alive change their state depending on the number of neighbouring cells that are alive according to the following following rules:</p>
  
<ul>
<li>A cell's neighbours are the 8 cells that touch it horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
</li><li>If a cell is alive and the number of living neighbouring cells is 0 or 1, then in the next generation the cell dies of loneliness.
</li><li>If a cell is alive and has 4 or more neighbouring cells that are also neighbouring cells, then in the next generation the cell dies of overpopulation.
</li><li>A living cell with 2 or 3 living neighbouring cells remains alive in the next generation.
</li><li>If a dead cell has exactly 3 living neighbouring cells, it changes to the state of a living cell in the next generation.
</li><li>All cell births and deaths take place simultaneously, i.e. the changes are based on the current state and never on the future state.<p></p>
</li></ul>

<p>The following figures illustrate two consecutive states of a game of life configuration.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Write a program that, given an initial state and number <i>K</i> indicating the number of generations to compute, produces the state obtained after <i>K</i> generations.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>The first line contains three positive integers: the number of rows <i>R</i> and columns <i>C</i> that determine the size of the grid and the number of iterations <i>K</i> it must perform.</p>

<p>This is followed by <i>R</i> lines of characters representing the initial state of the game. Dead cells are represented by '.' and live cells by '#'.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>You must print the state of the game after <i>K</i> iterations, i.e. <i>R</i> rows, each with <i>C</i> characters representing the game grid with the dead cells marked with '.' and the live cells with '#'.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>0 ≤ <i>R,C</i> ≤ 50</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>dimensions of the grid</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1 ≤ <i>K</i> ≤ 50</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>number of generations</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
