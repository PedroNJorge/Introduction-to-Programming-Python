<h2>[IP097] Neo's Error Awakening</h2>

<p><img src="./31144846710909554" align="right" width="300">
Neo has just begun his training aboard the Nebuchadnezzar. Morpheus sits across from him, a faint smile on his face.
<br> 
<br>
"Neo," he begins, "you've taken the red pill and awakened to the truth, but the Matrix is not 
just a world of code—it's a world of errors."
<br>
<br>
"Errors?" Neo asks.
<br> 
<br>
"Yes," Morpheus replies. "Errors are glitches in the system. Unchecked, they can crash 
your programs — or, in the Matrix, your mind."
</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>
  Write a function <span class="function">division(a,b)</span> that,
  that given two numbers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> returns the string <code>"a/b = (a/b)"</code> (note that you don't need to round: just return the result of <code>a/b</code> as a string in the respective position).</p>

<p>When <i>b</i> is zero, the function catches the respective exception and returns the string 
  <code>"Error: Division by 0!"</code>. Additonally, if an argument is not a number in the function call, the function should also catch the equivalent error and returns the string <code>"Error: Unsupported type(s) for division!"</code>".
</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>-1000 ≤ <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> ≤ 1000</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>Numbers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td><i>a</i> and <i>b</i> can be given as strings</td>
     <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
      <td>This scenario will also raise an exception</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
