<h2>[IP085] Dataset Confusion</h2>

<p><img src="./8614907669189809" align="right">
Lord Nibbler has found a peculiar dataset containing a mix of integers nested within lists and tuples. As part of his cosmic experiments, Nibbler needs to calculate the total sum of all the integers within the dataset, regardless of how deeply nested they are. However, being a creature of immense power, Nibbler doesn't want to bother with writing the solution himself. He needs your help!</p>
  
<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Write a function <span class="function">sum_integers(data)</span> that takes a single input, <i>data</i>, which can be a list or tuple containing integers, strings, doubles, lists, or tuples, with nested structures of arbitrary depth. It should return the sum of all the integers, regardless of how nested they were, and ignore any non-integers values.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>1 ≤ <i>|data|</i>  ≤ 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>length of data (when flattened)</td>
  </tr>

</tbody></table>
