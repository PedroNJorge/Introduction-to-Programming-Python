<h2>[IP088] Intergalatic Shopping</h2>

<p><img src="./8614907669189809" align="right">
Amy Wong-Kroker is planning a shopping spree during her intergalactic travels. She has a set of <i>n</i> coins, each with a specific value. Amy wants to figure out all the unique quantities of money she can create using any combination of these coins (including using none of them).</p>

<p>To satisfy her curiosity, she needs a program that calculates all the distinct quantities she can make. Since Amy is busy shopping for outfits and accessories, she’s leaving this task to you!</p>
  
<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Write a function <span class="function">quantities(coins)</span>  that receives a list of integers, representing the values of the <i>n</i> coins Amy has. The function should return a set containing all possible unique sums of these coins.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>1 ≤ <i>n</i>  ≤ 15</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>number of coins</td>
  </tr>

</tbody></table>
