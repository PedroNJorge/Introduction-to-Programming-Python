<h2>[IP086] Binary Communication</h2>

<p><img src="./8614907669189809" align="right">
Bender finds himself in a peculiar situation. Due to a temporary glitch in his processing core, he can now only communicate in binary.  But there's a catch - his circuits can handle only a limited number of 1's in a message at a time. To avoid overheating, Bender needs your help to generate all possible binary strings of lengths ranging from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, inclusive, while ensuring that no string has more than <i>k</i> 1's.</p>

<p>He refuses to write this program himself because he's busy bending things and drinking oil, so it’s up to you to save the day! Help Bender generate his new vocabulary of binary strings.</p>
  
<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Write a function <span class="function">binary(a, b, k)</span> that returns a list containing all possible binary strings of lengths between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, inclusive, with at most <i>k</i> 1's. Each string should consist only of the characters '0' and '1'.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>1 ≤ <i>a</i> ≤ <i>b</i>  ≤ 10</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>range to consider</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0 ≤ <i>k</i>  ≤ 10</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>maximum number of 1's</td>
  </tr>

</tbody></table>
