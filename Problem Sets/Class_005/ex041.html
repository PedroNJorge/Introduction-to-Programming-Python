<h2>[IP041] The extremes</h2>

It was then that the Mad Hatter popped up from behind his teapot tower, tipping his oversized hat and grinning from ear to ear.</p>

<p>Well, well! I see you’ve been entertaining our dear Caterpillar and those troublesome twins, but now it’s my turn!" he exclaimed. His eyes twinkled as he twirled a cup of tea in one hand. "You see, I’m mad about extremes—yes, the beginning and the end, the first and the last, the maximum and the minimum!"</p>
  
<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Write a function <span class="function">extremes(words)</span> that given a tuple <i>words</i> containing several strings, return a tuple <i>(a,b)</i> where <i>a</i> is the length of the smallest string and <i>b</i> is the length of the largest string.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>1 ≤ |words| ≤ 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>number of words</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1 ≤ |w<sub>i</sub>| ≤ 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>size of each word</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
