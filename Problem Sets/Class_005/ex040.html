<h2>[IP040] Word clean up</h2>

<p><img src="./6211506312811518" align="right" width="300">
Just as you were about to catch your breath from the Cheshire Cat's challenge, the Caterpillar, puffing on his hookah and perched atop a giant mushroom, gazed down at you. With an air of mystery and curiosity, he asked, "Who... are... you?"</p>

<p>Before you could answer, the Caterpillar leaned forward, exhaling a cloud of smoke in the shape of a question mark, and said, "Prove your worth! I want to see if you are clever enough to clean up words, like I clean up my thoughts."</p>
  
<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Write a function <span class="function">remove_all(word, ch)</span> that given a string <i>word</i> constituted by lower case letters and a lower case letter <i>ch</i>, returns a new string that is the same as the original one but with all occurrences of character <i>ch</i> removed.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>1 ≤ |word| ≤ 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>size of the input string</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
