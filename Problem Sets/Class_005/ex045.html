<h2>[IP045] A needle in a haystack
</h2>

  As you managed to impress the Queen of Hearts with your swapping skills, the Dodo shuffled over, flapping his wings excitedly. He was deep in thought, and after a moment, he looked at you with wide eyes and said, "I’ve been thinking, yes, thinking a lot. What happens when we remove things, yet still find meaning?"</p>

<p>The Dodo continued, "Imagine a word, yes? A perfectly good word. But what if we could remove certain letters — pluck them out, one by one — yet still find another word hidden within? Fascinating, isn’t it?"</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Write a function <span class="function">substring(needle, haystack)</span> that given two strings <i>needle</i> and <i>haystack</i> returns True if <i>needle</i> can be found as (non necessarily contiguous) substring in <i>haystack</i>. This is the same as saying that  <i>needle</i> can be obtained from <i>haystack</i> if we remove zero or more letters from it.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>1 ≤ |needle| ≤ 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>size of the string to look for</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1 ≤ |haystack| ≤ 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>size of the string that should contain another string</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
