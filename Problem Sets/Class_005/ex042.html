<h2>[IP042] Important letters</h2>

<p><img src="./6211506312811518" align="right" width="300">
Just as you finished impressing the Mad Hatter, you heard a faint creak. Turning around, you saw the Doorknob slowly twisting and turning, yawning as he woke from a long nap. With his sleepy, yet curious eyes fixed on you, he spoke:</p>

"Ah, I see you’ve been through quite the adventure with the others, haven’t you? But let me ask you this, clever one: do you know what’s really important? Letters! And not just any letters - certain ones are more important than others and are all that count!"<p></p>
  
<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Write a function <span class="function">count(word, letters)</span> that given a string <i>word</i> and a string <i>letters</i> indicating the set of  important characters, returns the amount of characters in <i>word</i> that are present also in <i>letters</i>.</p>

<p>For instance, the call <i>count("madame", "aeiou")</i> should return 3, as there are 3 characters in "madame" (two 'a's and one 'e') that also appear in "aeiou".</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>1 ≤ |word| ≤ 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>size of input word</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1 ≤ |letters| ≤ 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>size of string containing the characters to count</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
