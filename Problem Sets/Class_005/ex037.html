<h2>[IP037] Palindromic task</h2>

<p><img src="./6211506312811518" align="right" width="300">
After the first round of Python slicing challenges, Tweedledum scratched his head and said, "I need something more... something that requires not just slicing but also a bit of logic. A true test of wits!"</p>

<p>He pondered for a moment, and then, with a gleam in his eye, declared, "I want to see if our student can tell <b>whether a word is a palindrome!</b>"</p>

<p>Tweedledee, amused by his brother’s increasing demands, asked, "And what is a palindrome, dear brother, in case the student has forgotten?"</p>

<p>With a grin, Tweedledum explained, "A palindrome is a word that reads the same forward as it does backward. For instance, 'madam' and 'racecar' are palindromes. I want to see if the student can use slicing to check this!"</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>
  Write a function <span class="function">palindrome(word)</span> that given a string <i>word</i> constituted by lower case letters, returns <i>True</i> if the word is a palindrome and <i>False</i> if it isn't.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>1 ≤ |word| ≤ 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>size of the input string</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
