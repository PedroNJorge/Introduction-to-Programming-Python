<h2>[IP046] Word evolution
</h2>

<p><img src="./6211506312811518" align="right" width="300">
Just when you thought the adventures in Wonderland couldn’t get any more curious, the White Rabbit scurried into view, his pocket watch clutched tightly in his hands. He looked frantic, glancing around as if he were late for an important date.</p>

<p>"Oh dear! Oh dear!" he exclaimed, pausing just long enough to catch his breath. “You wouldn’t believe what I’ve just stumbled upon while looking at this confounded clock. I’ve discovered how words evolve! Fascinating creatures, those little words. But I’m late, I’m late! I need to understand this better, and you — yes, you — might just help me!"</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Write a function <span class="function">evolve(initial, n)</span> that given a string <i>initial</i> (made up of just letters 'A' and 'B') and an integer <i>n</i>, prints exactly <i>n+1</i> lines showing first the initial string and then the next <i>n</i> generations of the string according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any 'A' becomes 'AB'
  </li><li>Any 'B' becomes 'A'
</li></ul>

<p>For instance, if we start with "A" and ask for <i>n=4</i> generations, the following happens:</p>

<pre>n=0:               A        initial
                  / \
n=1:             A   B      the initial single A spawned into AB by rule (A → AB), rule (B → A) couldn't be applied
                /|    \
n=2:           A B     A    former string AB with all rules applied, A spawned into AB again, former B turned into A
              /| |     |\
n=3:         A B A     A B  note all A's producing a copy of themselves in the first place, then a B, which turns ...
            /| | |\   /| |
n=4:       A B A A B A B A  ... into an A one generation later, starting to repeat then
</pre>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>1 ≤ |needle| ≤ 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>size of the string to look for</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1 ≤ |haystack| ≤ 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>size of the string that should contain another string</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
