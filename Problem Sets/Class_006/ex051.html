<h2>[IP051] Rotating Toys</h2>

<p><img src="./5534842305600104" align="right" width="150">
Maggie Simpson, the silent but observant baby of the Simpson family, is having an especially playful day. She's surrounded by her favorite toys: her pacifier, a teddy bear, a toy train, a building block, and her beloved stuffed rabbit. Maggie lines them up in a row on the floor, delighting in the colorful sequence. But after a few minutes, she gets an idea - she wants to see what the row of toys would look like if each toy moved one spot over, with the last one coming around to the front.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>
  Write a function <span class="function">rotate(lst, dir)</span> that given a list <i>lst</i> rotates it to the right (if <i>dir</i> is"right") or to the left (if <i>dir</i> is "left").</p>

<p>A rotation to the right means shifting all elements one position to the right (with the last element coming to the front). For instance, the list [1,2,3,4] rotated to the right becomes [4,1,2,3].</p>

<p>A rotation to the left means shifting all elements one position to the left (with the first element going to the back). For instance, the list [1,2,3,4] rotated to the left becomes [2,3,4,1].</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>0 ≤ <i>|lst|</i> ≤ 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>Number of elements in list</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
