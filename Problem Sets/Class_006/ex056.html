<h2>[IP056] Turn it Back!</h2>

<p><img src="./5534842305600104" align="right" width="130">
After Patty successfully transformed the messy  matrix into a simple list, her sister Selma, equally cynical but always looking for a new challenge, decides she wants to put a spin on the project. Selma had been hearing about the various ways people organize data, and she thought it would be fun to take Patty's newly flattened list and turn it back into a matrix. After all, what’s the point of making things easy if you can’t complicate them a little?</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>
  Write a function <span class="function">list_to_matrix(lst, r, c)</span> that given a list <i>lst</i> with <i>r * c</i> elements, returns a matrix with <i>r</i> rows and <i>c</i> columns given as a list of lists where the elements come from the list: the first row corresponds to the first <i>c</i> elements of the list, the second row to the next <i>c</i> elements, and so on.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>1 ≤ <i>|lst|</i> ≤ 10&nbsp;000</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>Size of the list</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1 ≤ <i>r, c</i> ≤ 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>Number of rows and columns</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
