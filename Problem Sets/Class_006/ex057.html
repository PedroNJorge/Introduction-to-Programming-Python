<h2>[IP057] A Summing Project</h2>

<p><img src="./5534842305600104" align="right" width="120">
Marge Simpson, ever the supportive sister, has been watching Patty and Selma dive into the world of data manipulation with their matrix projects. She’s impressed by how they turned the chaotic hart into a simplified list and then back into a matrix, appreciating the complexity behind what seemed like simple tasks. Inspired by their enthusiasm and recognizing the potential for fun, Marge decides it’s time to try her hand at something a little more challenging herself: summing two matrices!</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>
  Write a function <span class="function">sum(a, b)</span> that given two matrices <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> (given as lists of lists), both with <i>r</i> rows and <i>c</i> columns, returns a new matrix <i>c</i> which is the result of summing <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. This matrix should also have <i>r</i> rows and <i>c</i> columns and <i>c<sub>i,j</sub></i> should be equal to summing <i>a<sub>i,j</sub></i> with <i>b<sub>i,j</sub></i>.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>1 ≤ <i>r, c</i> ≤ 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>Number of rows and columns</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
