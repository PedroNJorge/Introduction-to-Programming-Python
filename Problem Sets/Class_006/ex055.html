<h2>[IP055] Messy Matrix</h2>

<p><img src="./5534842305600104" align="right" width="130">
Patty Bouvier, Marge’s gruff, chain-smoking sister, is usually too busy working at the DMV or binge-watching her favorite soap operas to dabble in anything tech-related. But one day, her boss hands her a data project: sorting a complicated DMV seating chart that’s been printed as a grid. The chart is a messy matrix of DMV employee numbers, arranged in rows and columns that doesn’t make much sense to anyone except her boss. Patty is unimpressed. She thinks: <i>"Why can't this just be one simple list so I can get on with my day?"</i></p>  

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>
  Write a function <span class="function">matrix_to_list(m)</span> that given a matrix <i>m</i> given as a list of lists with <i>r</i> rows and <i>c</i> columns, returns a new list with all the elements of the matrix, first with the elements from the first row, then the second row, and so on.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>1 ≤ <i>r, c</i> ≤ 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>Number of rows and columns</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
