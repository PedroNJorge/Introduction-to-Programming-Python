<h2>[IP048] List Transformation</h2>

<p><img src="./5534842305600104" align="right" width="150">
  Moe Szyslak, the famously grouchy bartender of <i>The Simpsons</i>, has been dealing with a new trend among his regulars at Moe’s Tavern. One evening, Comic Book Guy, Professor Frink, and Lisa Simpson are huddled at a corner table, discussing a strange concept they call <i>"list transformation"</i>. Moe isn’t exactly sure what it means, but it has something to do with math, and he’s a little annoyed at how it’s taking his regulars' attention away from his drink specials.</p>

<p>The trio explains that they’re debating a mathematical problem where you take a list of numbers and multiply each element by a constant value <i>k</i>. This could be useful, Comic Book Guy suggests, for calculating tips on bills, tallying up loyalty points, or even keeping tabs on how much Homer has been drinking (which, of course, keeps the bill sky-high).</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>
  Write a function <span class="function">transform(lst, k)</span> that given a list of integers <i>lst</i> changes the list so that each element on the list is multiplied by <i>k</i>.

</p><h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>1 ≤ <i>|lst|</i> ≤ 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>size of the input list</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-1000 ≤ <i>lst<sub>i</sub></i> ≤ 1000</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>elements of the list</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-1000 ≤ <i>k</i> ≤ 1000</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>multiplication factor</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
