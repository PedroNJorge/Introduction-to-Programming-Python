<h2>[IP050] Drunken Lists</h2>

<p><img src="./5534842305600104" align="right" width="180">
 One late night at Moe's Tavern, Barney Gumble, Springfield’s most enthusiastic (and perpetually inebriated) patron, finds himself in a philosophical mood. He starts wondering about the world through his "drunken perspective". Everything seems a bit mixed up and jumbled, and, to him, that actually feels kind of... fun!</p>

<p>As he stares at a list of drink specials Moe has written up on the wall, Barney thinks it would be hilarious if the list got "drunk" too - where every pair of items in it is swapped around, just like his wobbly view of the world. He laughs to himself, imagining a world where things are always out of order, and decides to create something to capture that feeling.</p>
  
<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>
  Write a function <span class="function">swap_list(lst)</span> that given a list <i>lst</i> swaps all consecutive pairs of elements. For instance, [1,2,3,4] should become [2,1,4,3]. If the list as an odd number of elements, the last element should stay at its position, as it cannot swap with any other element.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>0 ≤ <i>|lst|</i> ≤ 100</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>Number of elements in list</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<br>

<table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" bgcolor="black" border="0">
  <tbody><tr bgcolor="#e2e2e2">
    <td>Example Function Calls</td>
    <td>Example Output</td>
  </tr>
  <tr bgcolor="white">
    <td valign="top">
<pre>lst1 = ['a','b','c','d','e','f']
swap_list(lst1)
print(lst1)
lst2 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
swap_list(lst2)
print(lst2)
</pre>
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
<pre>['b', 'a', 'd', 'c', 'f', 'e']
[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 8, 7, 9]
</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
