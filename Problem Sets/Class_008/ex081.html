<h2>[IP081] A Girl has no Name</h2>

<p><img src="./7055768355287504" align="right">
  Arya Stark, training with the Faceless Men, has been given a challenge to prove her skills in analyzing texts. Her task is to extract the initial letters of all words from a given text, determine their frequency of appearance, and then create a (lowercase) string from these letters. The string should be sorted in descending order of frequency. If two letters have the same frequency, they should appear in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>Imagine for instance the text is <i>"tark Lannister TaRgArYeN ARRYN tully"</i>. Regarding the initial letters, there are two <i>t</i>'s, one <i>a</i>, one <i>l</i> and one <i>s</i>. The desired string should there be "tals", as <i>t</i> is the most frequent and them come <i>a</i>, <i>l</i> and <i>s</i>, all with frequency one, but sorted alphabetically. </p>
  
<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Write a function <span class="function">sort_initials(text)</span> that given a string <i>text</i>, returns a string made only by the lower case version of the initial letters of each word in the sentence (a word is a space separated sequence of chars). The letters should come in decreasing order of frequency and in case of a tie in increasing alphabetical order.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>1 ≤ <i>|text|</i>  ≤ 200</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>length of text</td>
  </tr>

</tbody></table>

<p>You can also be assured that the text will only be made by whitespace and upper and lowercase letters adn there will always exist at least one word.</p>
