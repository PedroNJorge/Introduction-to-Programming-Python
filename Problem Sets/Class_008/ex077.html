<h2>[IP077] The Art of Storytelling</h2>

<p><img src="./7055768355287504" align="right">
Oberyn Martell, known as the Red Viper of Dorne, is in love with the art of storytelling and the choice of words used in Westeroos' romantic poems and texts. To analyze the richness of vocabulary in a text, he wants to determine the number of unique words present. </p> 

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>Write a function <span class="function">count_words(text)</span> that given a string <i>text</i>, returns the number of unique words in the text. A "word" is defined as any sequence of alphabetic characters separated by non-alphabetic characters (which in this problem may only be whitespaces). The function should be case-insensitive, meaning "Winter" and "winter" are considered the same word.</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<p>The following limits are guaranteed in all the test cases that will be given to your program:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>1 ≤ <i>|text|</i>  ≤ 200</td>
    <td>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td>
    <td>length of text</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>You can also be assured that the text will only be made by whitespace and upper and lowercase letters.</p>
